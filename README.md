# SaveAllDocsAsPDF
Personal project I wrote in a few hours to resave all google docs as a PDF file, aiming to keep it minimal.

  This file will download each doc file as a pdf, and resave it in the same directory with _resaved.pdf appended
  It will not bother with files not modified before the last time the program was ran
  This program will delete files previous PDF versions of the file (It should probably be a re-upload, but that's caused issues unfortunately)
  
I'm not taking responsibility if you accidentally delete all your files using this. Seriously. If you can't read the code, don't run this program.
